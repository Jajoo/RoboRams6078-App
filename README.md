# RoboRams6078-App
So this is kind of ambitous (I know barebones java and can barley navigate around in Andriod Studio) but I'm going to try anyway 4/6/16

#What this app will do
1. Scouting (main objective)

  A) Form to enter data
    I) Make the xml Thing to do this
    II) Have Java export the data to rapsberry pi
  B) Back end too save data (might have to learn sql for this, use python? Server? Raspberry Pi?)
    I) Somehow have Java export the data to a python server on my raspberry pi
    II) Somehow give Java the data when it calls for it
    III) Security? Will someone even try to steal our data? (Probably would just cause they can lol)
2. Schedule for match times
  A)Another xml form for this
  B) Have Java export the data to the raspberry pi
  C) Hava pi server give data when app calls for it
3. Games (probably not going to happen)
  A) Flappy Bird but without bird it's the robot
  B) Snake but with something robot related
