# RoboRams6078-App
So this is kind of ambitous (I know barebones java and can barley navigate around in Andriod Studio) but I'm going to try anyway 4/6/16

## What this app will do
  1. Scouting (main objective)
    1. Form to enter data
      * Make the xml Thing to do this
      * ~~Have Java export the data to rapsberry pi~~
      * New Idea: Just figure out how to save the data then make it into a QR code that I can scan. No internet needed

    2. ~~Back end to save data (might have to learn sql for this, use python? Server? Raspberry Pi?)~~
      * ~~Somehow have Java export the data to a python server on my raspberry pi~~
      * ~~Probably and API, don't reinvent the wheel~~
    3. ~~Somehow give Java the data when it calls for it~~
      * ~~Same as before~~
    4. ~~Security? Will someone even try to steal our data? (Probably would just cause they can lol)~~
      * ~~Become a 1337 hacker, problem solved~~
  2. Have my own app or just add in QR reader to RoboRApp OR Use a regular QR reader app and get the data somehow
    1. Once I get the data how will I represent it
      * List with a search bar, pictures maybe of robot (I don't know if that will work with the QR code)
      * PIE chart with how many teams can do whatever

  3. Schedule for match times
    1. Another xml form for this
    2. ~~Have Java export the data to the raspberry pi~~
    3. ~~Hava pi server give data when app calls for it~~
  
  4. Games (probably not going to happen)
    1. Flappy Bird but without bird it's the robot
    2. Snake but with something robot related

## Where am I at right now?
Haven't even started yet 4/6/16

Got the button working to switch between XML forms 4/24/16

Checkboxes yo

Working on impleting something like zxing (https://github.com/zxing/zxing), a barcode maker so I don't have to fiddl with servers 5/20


##Problems
If I'm planning to try not to use internet how will I get all the apps sync'd up with match times and such, maybe have app devices plugged up and sync'd before matches

Need to stop procastinating and playing video games

Trying to get Android Studio working with GitHub so I don't have to learn git, might have to learn git 

Have had like no time, plannig on working Sunday 5/22/16
